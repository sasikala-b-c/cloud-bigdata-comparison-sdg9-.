# Interpretation Guide

- Performance: prioritize end-to-end runtime and shuffle volumes. Consider partitioning skew.
- Cost: normalize by dataset size. Note discounts/spot use separately.
- Elasticity: measure time-to-first-task and autoscaling convergence qualitatively.
- Manageability: count setup steps, IAM friction, debugging/observability UX.
- Sustainability: prefer energy-efficient regions and preemptible capacity where feasible.
